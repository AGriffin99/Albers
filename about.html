    My inspiration for this project was my love of the anime sailormoon. This project was a little difficult to me after I lot motivation, but ti was itll verey fun to do an to learn hover states.Its interesting how to have the different states change the properties of the div. Becuase of this I use alot of the colors white, yellow, and black and changing circles  and squares. The 2nd frestudy is to mimick how stars look to use when we are looking up at them and when you hover over they turn into purple circles.
